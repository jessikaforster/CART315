Iterative Prototype 3

Changes based on previous playtest:

* Based on the previous playtest of this game, the primary change that I made was to make the overall game more eye-catching for the user. I feel that that is the one element that has been lacking and has caused users to not seem as focused as they should be. That being said, I added brighter colours and more elements to the map in order for it all to pop and draw the users attention.

Design Hypothesis:

* The final element that I wanted to explore is whether adding those bright colours would attract the user's eyes to any specific elements. The aspect that I would want them to pay attention to are the coloured platforms as those are the new part of the game that would help them if they are on the wrong path. Therefore, my design hypothesis is whether the user's will notice the pops of colour and interpret them as hints.

Playtest Comments:

*	Add more coins
*	Add more enemies


Reflection on playtest results:

* I learned that adding more enemies and coins were the final element that needed to be added to the game in order to keep the player fully focused on making it through the maze as they had to dodge the enemies and the coins were beneficial for them to collect. I also learned that adding colour did in fact cause the users to notice smaller elements of the game's overall design.

Design hypothesis answer:

* Most playtesters did comment on the colours and realize that, especially the platforms, were hints that they should be paying attention to.
