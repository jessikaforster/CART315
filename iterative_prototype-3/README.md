Iterative Prototype 2

Changes based on previous playtest:

* Based on the previous playtest of this game, the primary change that I made was adding more obstacles and hints to the map. In doing so, it will spare the user the inconvenience of completing the entire path only to find out at the very end that they followed the incorrect one. The primary hint is within the colours of the larger platforms. Regarding the obstacles, platforms were added that the user must jump on. As obstacles were added, I also added platforms below the path in order to potentially catch the user if they fall in a few spots on the map.

Design Hypothesis:

* An issue that I wanted to correct was the difficulty in knowing what is the correct direction the user must follow without completely removing that mystery from the game. As mentioned previously, in order to aid the users I added colour to the larger platforms in hopes that it would help them change their way before reaching the very end. That being said, my design hypothesis is whether it will be less likely for the user to find their way entirely down the wrong path if there are subtle hints indicating that they should consider turning around.

Playtest Comments:

*	Add hints with text
*	Add more enemies
*	Add music
*	Add time limit
*	Add moving platforms
*	Respawn when you fall off path
*	Level up when diamond is collected
*	Add sound effects when jumping, collecting diamond, etc.
*	Adjust user view
*	Add more coins to collect
*	Add heart system
*	Make scene change over time i.e. sun comes up


Reflection on playtest results:

* I learned that adding obstacles and more colour to the map grabbed the users attention more than before and made them more eager to reach the finish line. I also found that adding points where they were saved from falling gave them a sense of comfort and made gameplay less frustrating. As the coloured platform hints did help, I will consider adding more with text and continuing to add more variant on the path in order to enrich the gaming experience even more.

Design hypothesis answer:

* For some users, colour alone was enough for them to understand the message, but for a few, it was not clear and text would have benefitted them more.
