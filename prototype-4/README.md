Prototype 4

Design Hypothesis:

* While creating this prototype, I pondered over what would motivate the user the most to reach the finish line and I realized, it is games that frustrate them. Although the concept is simple, the user can fall to their death with the blink of an eye as they see the goal right in front of them which I believe would motivate them even more to keep trying over and over again until they are successful. The concept is that the user must move forward and choose either the left or right side to let themselves walk past and hope that they land on another platform in order to be one step closer to the finish line. If they fail to land on a platform, they must restart. If this idea is chosen for my final game, I will create levels where the concept remains the same, but there are variations that make it more difficult for the user to reach the final platform. I also think it would be interesting to play with colour in leading the user to take certain paths, there is a lot of potential with this idea to create a game that would engage the user until the very end.

Playtest Comments:

* Add more variation between the platforms
* Fast paced music would work with the concept
* Consider using a different colour palette
* Find a way for user to be unable to peak down
* Add time limit everytime user lands on new platform
* Make the platforms move
* Respawn after falling
* Collecting diamond brings user to next level
* Add hearts for the user
* View from the top instead of first person
* Circus theme could be interesting
* Have items user can pick up
* Add hints to give user better chance of picking correct side
* Difficulty level is good, just frustrating enough
* Adding more visuals to make game more attractive
* Add checkpoints on longer levels

Design hypothesis answer:

* Despite the simple concept, playtesters became frustrated as they failed to reach the finish line which motivated them to continue more and more.
