Prototype 3

Design Hypothesis:

* As I am creating my prototypes, I am doing my best to come up with ideas that could be expanded on to create a larger concept and a game that could consist of a variety of levels at varying difficulties. That being said, I created this game where the user must carefully make their way through a maze-like path in order to reach the center and collect the gem. If the user goes off the path even just slightly, they will fall off of the map and must restart. Due to how narrow the path is, the player is required to pay very close attention to every movement they make. Also, there are spaces and steps between certain platforms which forces the user to always be aware of what is coming up next in their path if they wish to make it to the centre. In order to add to the difficulty of the game, I am considering adding a countdown as well as enemies that would be placed on the path in various spots. All that to say, the narrow path requires the user to pay close attention to their every movement and there is a lot of potential to add more to the game to elevate it and make it more difficult. Most importantly, my design hypothesis is whether the user will cheat or not, I anticipate that they will follow the path I have designated.

Playtest Comments:

* Bigger spaces between paths
* Add texture to the floor to make it easier to tell when character is jumping
* Jingle sound when you get the gem
* People that think of cheating discover something special, thinking outside the box gets rewarded
* Difficulty level is good
* Vertical navigation
* Larger platforms to take a break
* Pickable items, spots that increase speed, invisible time (floating to skip ahead)
* Gust of wind tries to blow you off (make game as difficult as possible)
* Jumping view is not great
* Vertical progression, falling into another maze rather than dying, progressively going to the top
* Environmental changes
* Donâ€™t immediately die when you fall
* Life system
* Music (depending on level)
* Camera angle remains in same spot
* Cheating as game meaning
* 3rd person view
* Respawn after a few seconds
* Long level, add checkpoints
* Moving platforms
* Collect the diamond to level up
* Limited number of blocks to jump on, strategize number of spots you can go on to win
* Life bar
* Make sure they follow path using diamonds on path that would raise their health back, prevents cheating

Design hypothesis answer:

* Every playtester cheated or tried to cheat which means I must make it more difficult to find ways to make it to the goal faster
