Jessika ForsterPrototype 2Design Hypothesis:* Through these prototypes, I wish to create games that would be popular among users and also use ideas that are flexible to changes if I wish to choose them for my final assignment. This design consists of a collection of 4 race cars and a large course for them to drive through. Throughout the course, there are diamonds that the user must collect. Only once they have collected them all will the game be over. The one missing item from the game is an obstacle that gets in the way of the user as they are attempting to complete the challenge. I am unsure whether I should implement a time limit for all of the diamonds to be collected or for there to be enemies that must be avoided. To summarize, the primary goal of the game would be for the user to drive through the racecourse collecting a variety of diamonds in order to win the game, but an obstacle must be added to make this more difficult. Playtest Comments:* **Rather than implementing a time limit or enemies to avoid, adding both would make the game even more interesting.* Add other cars driving on the road.* Add movement to the diamonds.* Make path that user must follow clearer.* Add more variety to the track.* Allow user to select the vehicle they wish to drive.
