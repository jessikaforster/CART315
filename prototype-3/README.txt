Jessika ForsterPrototype 3Design Hypothesis:* As I am creating my prototypes, I am doing my best to come up with ideas that could be expanded on to create a larger concept and a game that could consist of a variety of levels at varying difficulties. That being said, I created this game where the user must carefully make their way through a maze-like path in order to reach the center and collect the gem. If the user goes off the path even just slightly, they will fall off of the map and must restart. Due to how narrow the path is, the player is required to pay very close attention to every movement they make. Also, there are spaces and steps between certain platforms which forces the user to always be aware of what is coming up next in their path if they wish to make it to the centre. In order to add to the difficulty of the game, I am considering adding a countdown as well as enemies that would be placed on the path in various spots. All that to say, the narrow path requires the user to pay close attention to their every movement and there is a lot of potential to add more to the game to elevate it and make it more difficult.
