Final CART 315 Game

Design Journal

* I believe that the playtest results from the iterative prototyping allowed for me to make my game as enjoyable as possible from the user's perspective as I was receiving user input through the playtests every week. When it came time to playtest the last iterative prototype before the final submission, I received feedback that resulted in me only needing to make minor adjustments such as adding more villains and adding more coins for the user to collect. Through these playtests, I was able to see how, at first, I received a lot of feedback as to what I should change, but as I worked more and more, I could see that the users were enjoying the experience more and more. That being said, I feel that my final game is one that players would want to keep coming back to as a result of all of the feedback I received from users throughout the design process.
