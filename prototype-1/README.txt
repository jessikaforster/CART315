Jessika ForsterPrototype 1Design Hypothesis:* The game I am building is meant to keep the user as focused as possible as it is a game of speed. They must move as quickly as possible as the food is falling down the hill. The hill has a grey, metallic texture in order to represent a kitchen counter. There are also squares within the counter that the user can jump on to stay safe from the falling items. The one decision I have been unable to make is whether the user should dodge the items or aim to collect them. An option would be for the user’s goal to be to eat them, but as they are so large, a potential, interesting option would be for them to be meant to be avoided. All that to say, the focus of the game is for the user to remain alert, but the primary goal is yet to be decided.Playtest Comments:* **User’s first instinct is to dodge food as it approaches them.* Blocks for user to jump on should be larger.* Find a way for food to continue moving constantly as some stop midway.* Add more details to make the space more eye-catching.* User could be holding an item to hit incoming food.* Food could move at different speeds and have different material qualities.* Add less food incoming at once in order to facilitate dodging.* Make slope less steep in order for user to have more time to move and dodge.* Add hearts to user so after they get hit a few times they can no longer play.
